# Boxing-Game-Exercise

## About

The Boxing Game Exercise is a fun and interactive way to learn how to apply conditional statements in JavaScript focusing on if, else if, and else statements. In this game, two players take turns delivering punches to each other with damage values that vary randomly between 1 and 10 points. The game uses conditional logic to handle different gameplay scenarios, such as basic hits, critical hits, and knockouts. If a player's health drops to zero or below, they are knocked out, and the game ends.

This exercise is designed to help you understand how to apply conditionals to determine game outcomes and player health status.

## Demonstrable Skills

- Conditional Statements: Learn how to use if, else if, and else statements to handle different gameplay scenarios like basic hits, critical hits, and knockouts.

- Random Number Generator: Generate random numbers to simulate damage and create unpredictable game outcomes.

- Troubleshooting and Debugging: Work through problems and use conditional logic to fix any issues in gameplay.

## Overall Gameplay

In this boxing game, two players will face off against each other delivering random damage points to their opponent. Here’s a breakdown of the damage types and how they work:

- Basic Hit: If the damage is less than 6, it’s a basic hit.

- Critical Hit: If the damage is between 6 and 9, it’s a critical hit.

- Knockout: If the damage is equal to 10, it’s a knockout punch.

## Expected Output

When the program is run in the terminal, the game will display messages that inform players of the outcome of each punch (basic hit, critical hit, knockout) along with the remaining health of each player. The game will continue until one player's health reaches 0 or below, at which point the game will announce the winner and end.
